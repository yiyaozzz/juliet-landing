# SEO Optimization Proposal for Juliet Landing Page

## Objective

To improve the on-page Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the Juliet landing page to achieve higher rankings in search engine results for the following target keywords:

*   First Date Labs
*   Juliet
*   dating coach
*   dating assistant

## Proposed Changes

To achieve this objective, I will implement the following on-page SEO best practices:

### 1. Keyword-Rich Metadata

I will refine the metadata in `src/app/layout.tsx` to be more keyword-focused. This includes:

*   **Title Optimization**: Crafting a title that is both user-friendly and includes primary keywords.
*   **Description Optimization**: Writing a compelling meta description that includes target keywords and encourages clicks from search results.
*   **Keywords Meta Tag**: Adding a `keywords` meta tag to reinforce the page's topic for search engines that still consider it.

### 2. Semantic HTML and Content Structure

The current placeholder page will be replaced with the full landing page content, structured with semantic HTML to provide clear signals to search engines about the content hierarchy and importance.

*   **Heading Structure**: Using a single `<h1>` for the main headline and logically structured `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags for subheadings.
*   **Content Markup**: Using `<p>` tags for paragraphs and `<strong>` or `<em>` tags to emphasize important keywords and phrases within the content.

### 3. Structured Data (Schema Markup)

I will add structured data to the page using the JSON-LD format. This will help search engines understand the content of your page in a more structured way and can lead to enhanced search results (rich snippets).

*   **`SoftwareApplication` Schema**: To clearly define "Juliet" as a software application.
*   **`Organization` Schema**: To identify "First Date Labs" as the organization behind the application.

## Expected Outcome

*   **Improved Search Engine Visibility**: Higher ranking in search results for the target keywords.
*   **Enhanced Click-Through Rate**: A well-crafted title and description can lead to more clicks from search engine users.
*   **Rich Snippets**: Structured data can enable rich snippets in search results, making your listing more attractive.

## Next Steps

1.  **Approval**: You approve this proposal.
2.  **Implementation**: I will implement the proposed changes.
3.  **Sitemap Submission**: After the changes are deployed, you should submit the website's sitemap to Google Search Console to expedite the indexing of the optimized page.
