# Story: Core Sections Implementation

Status: review

## Story

As a **website visitor**,

8. **AC8:** Benefit cards have hover effects for interactivity
9. **AC9:** HowItWorksSection.tsx displays 4-step process with numbered steps, titles, descriptions, and timeline connecting lines
10. **AC10:** Button.tsx reusable component created with primary/secondary variants and hover states
11. **AC11:** Card.tsx reusable component created for testimonials and benefits
12. **AC12:** Smooth scroll behavior implemented for CTA button clicks
13. **AC13:** All animations smooth and performant (no jank, using Framer Motion via motion/react)
14. **AC14:** Content from lib/constants.ts renders correctly in all sections
15. **AC15:** All 5 sections responsive at mobile (375px, 414px), tablet (768px, 1024px), desktop (1280px, 1920px)
16. **AC16:** Navigation bar displays logo (left), inline links ("Home · Press · Login") centered, and primary CTA button ("Get Early Access") aligned right
17. **AC17:** Navigation bar remains sticky at the top and applies a subtle drop shadow once the page scrolls

## Dev Notes

### Technical Summary

Build the persistent navigation and core value proposition sections of the landing page using React Server Components and Tailwind CSS. Create two reusable UI components (Button, Card) that will be used throughout the page with the **premium minimalist, aesthetic**. Implement the sticky Navbar (logo, links, CTA) plus 5 key sections that communicate Juliet's value: Hero (first impression + CTA), Social Proof (testimonials), Problem/Solution (comparison), Benefits (key value props), and How It Works (process explanation). All sections must be fully responsive with mobile-first design, smooth animations using Framer Motion (imported as `motion/react`), and content driven from TypeScript constants for easy maintainability.

**Design System Application:**

- **Color Palette:** Use bg-background (#fffdf6), bg-primary (#f9d544), bg-secondary (#cab5d4), bg-accent (#ffe362)
- **Borderless Design:** No borders on cards/buttons - use shadow-soft and shadow-hover for depth
- **White Space:** Generous padding and margins for premium feel
- **Typography:** Clean, large headlines with good letter-spacing

**Key Technical Decisions:**

- React Server Components for sections (no client-side state needed yet)
- Tailwind utility classes for styling (no CSS modules)
- Custom design tokens (background, primary, secondary, accent colors)
- Framer Motion for animations (motion/react import)
- Lucide React for icons
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Content-driven from lib/constants.ts for easy updates

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

- docs/stories/story-landing-page-2.context.md

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Debug Log References

No debug issues encountered. All implementations completed successfully with no errors.

### Completion Notes List

1. **Content Architecture**: Successfully implemented content-driven architecture with TypeScript types in lib/constants.ts. Created new interfaces: `NavigationLink`, `Benefit`, `ComparisonPoint`, `HowItWorksStep`, and updated `Testimonial` with optional `avatar` field.

2. **Component Implementation**: Created all 6 components (Navbar + 5 sections) using React client components with "use client" directive for Framer Motion animations. All components consume data from constants.ts as designed.

3. **Responsive Design**: Implemented mobile-first responsive patterns:
   - Navbar: Hidden nav links on mobile, visible on desktop with dot separators
   - Hero: Responsive typography scaling (4xl → 7xl)
   - Social Proof: Infinite marquee on mobile, 3-column grid on desktop
   - Problem/Solution: Stacked mobile, two-column desktop
   - Benefits: Stacked mobile, 2x2 grid on desktop
   - How It Works: Vertical timeline mobile, horizontal timeline desktop

4. **Animations**: Applied Framer Motion animations throughout:
   - Hero: Staggered fade-in with slide-up (0.2s delays)
   - Sections: Scroll-triggered animations via `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: true }}`
   - Benefits: Hover scale (1.02) and shadow transitions
   - Social Proof: Infinite marquee with 20s duration linear animation

5. **Technical Patterns**:
   - Icon mapping for dynamic Lucide icons from string names
   - Scroll detection in Navbar using useEffect and window scroll listener
   - Smooth scroll via scrollIntoView API
   - Visual contrast in Problem/Solution (gray tones vs vibrant accents)

6. **Linting**: Ran `npm run lint` with --max-warnings=0, passed with no errors.

7. **Pending Tasks**: Responsive testing at all breakpoints and performance testing for animations remain to be done during review/QA phase.
